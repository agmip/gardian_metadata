================

These are proof-of-concept JSON files for a selected group of
dataset from the `Gardian Platform`_.
This is part of a project to apply FAIR principles to CGIAR agronomic data
and making this data reusable to modelers and data analytics.

The purpose of the files are as follows:

SC1
  Map data to ontological terms

SC2
  Map data to ICASA terms and provide translation support to model formats.

SC3
  Quick indexing of unique values in a dataset, subset of the dataset,
  and simple statistics for the subset of data.
